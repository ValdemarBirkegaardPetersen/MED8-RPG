Generated Ending:
After travelling for many days, a lone wanderer stumbled into the city of Kingstone. Trying to make a name for himself, he wandered the streets and used his skills to survive.

He found himself helping farmers with their harvest, catching fish, unloading ship goods, and buying bread from the local baker. Despite encountering an alligator and experiencing food poisoning, he persevered and became stronger.

As he explored the city, he meditated at a holy shrine and read ancient texts at the library, gaining wisdom and intelligence. But he also performed a dark ritual, losing his health and damaging his karma.

Unfortunately, it was this ritual that led to his downfall. As he bled out on the ground, covered in bloody coins, the people of Kingstone would remember him as a mysterious and misguided wanderer. His skills and strengths were impressive, but his misguided actions would be his downfall.
