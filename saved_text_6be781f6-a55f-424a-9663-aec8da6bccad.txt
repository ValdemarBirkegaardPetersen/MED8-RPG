Generated Ending:
After many adventures and mishaps, the lone wanderer's legacy will be remembered in Kingstone through the stories of his unfortunate death. Despite his intentions to make a name for himself, his reputation remained tarnished due to his aggressive trading and unsuccessful attempts to attend noble parties. His strength and charisma remained low, although he managed to improve his intelligence along the way through reading and academic research. 

In the end, however, his luck ran out as he attempted to burgle a noble house. The tripwire trap he triggered resulted in the release of poisonous darts, which left him feeling nauseous and alone. As he lay in the street, unable to recover from the wound, his story became a cautionary tale of the dangers of greed and recklessness. 

The people of Kingstone may not celebrate his accomplishments or remember his name, but they will know the story of the lone wanderer who fell victim to his own desires. And perhaps, in that knowledge, they will learn to value wisdom and self-control above all else.
