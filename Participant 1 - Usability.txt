Generated Ending:
After travelling for many days, a lone wanderer stumbles into the city of Kingstone. Trying to make a name for himself, this is his story...

The wanderer, although he had his ups and downs, eventually found his way in the city of Kingstone. He tried his hand at trading, hunting, and even meditation. However, his uneventful life was about to meet an untimely end. 

One day, while meditating at the shrine, the wanderer had a negative experience which led to him collapsing, losing his consciousness. He never woke up, and the city mourned his loss.

The wanderer was not famed for his heroic feats or his amazing achievements, but he will be remembered as a kind soul who tried his best to help others. His final karma score of 0.2, although not high, is a testament to his selfless act of helping a beggar in need.

The city of Kingstone will remember him fondly, and his legacy will live on in their memories. His final stats showed a decline in almost every aspect, but it does not matter. What matters is the impact he made on the world around him. May he rest in peace.
