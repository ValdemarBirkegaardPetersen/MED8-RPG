Generated Ending:
After travelling for many days, a lone wanderer stumbled into the city of Kingstone, trying to make a name for himself. He began participating in academic research, performing unsanctioned dark rituals, and heading to the forest to hunt for game. He stumbled upon many opportunities, from making strides in his field, to acquiring more gold, strength, and intelligence. He even visited the bathhouse and got a new haircut, and his charisma increased significantly. However, he was not content. The wanderer turned to his dark rituals once again, seeking more power and knowledge. In doing so, he sacrificed his own life; consumed by the shadows that entered his body and ate him from the inside. 

In the end, the wanderer's name will forever be remembered in the city of Kingstone as an individual who searched for answers and power, but at the cost of his own life. While many showed interest in him, it was clear that he chose the path of darkness. His life may have been short, but he left a legacy of caution and mystery behind.
