Generated Ending:
With his passing, the lone wanderer's story fades into obscurity. Although he may not have found the fame and fortune he sought, Kingstone remembers him as a cautionary tale of foolishness and greed.

Some say he met his end because of his reckless actions, stealing from the city's nobles and breaking into homes uninvited. Others speculate that his poor health and low stamina betrayed him when he most needed it, and that his lack of intelligence and charisma made him easy prey for the dangers that lay within.

Whatever the truth may be, the city doesn't mourn his loss. Patrols continue to be vigilant against criminals, and many merchants thank their lucky stars that the wanderer never had the chance to steal from them.

His story may not be one of heroism or greatness, but it serves as a reminder that the choices we make have consequences, and that a life lived for selfish desires will ultimately lead only to ruin.
