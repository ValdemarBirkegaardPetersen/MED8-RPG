Generated Ending:
After many days of wandering around, the wanderer finally found himself on the brink of death, while meditating at the holy shrine. The events that led to this point are unknown to the people of Kingstone, but all that is remembered when his name is spoken is his final act of kindness - donating his remaining coins to the poor and needy before he passed away. His fate may have been out of his hands, but he used his influence to make one last positive impact on the world before he left it. The people of Kingstone may never know the true story of the wanderer's life, but they will always remember him as a kind soul who left behind a legacy of giving.
