Generated Ending:
After months of wandering Kingstone, the lone wanderer grew restless. He had attempted to make a name for himself in the city but all of his endeavors had led him to nothing but trouble. His pursuits of power and wealth had only left him with scars and empty pockets. 

Despite his failures, the wanderer continued to seek ways to improve himself. He spent long hours in the library, researching and studying, and even participated in academic research. His intellect grew with these experiences, allowing him to make significant strides in his field. 

Alas, the wanderer's pursuit of power led him down a dark path. His desperation for strength led him to perform unsanctioned dark rituals. These rituals had long-lasting consequences on his health, leaving him with blood loss and scars. He also attempted to rob a bank and sabotage a guard armory, leading to his eventual demise. 

Although his deeds in the city were often questionable, the citizens of Kingstone would remember him as a figure of complexity and intrigue. They would remember his intellect and his tireless pursuit of self-improvement. However, his violent tendencies would leave some citizens with disdain and distrust.

As the wanderer's story came to a close, the once-lone wanderer was mourned by few. However, his story would not be forgotten, remaining a complex and controversial figure in the annals of Kingstone's history.
