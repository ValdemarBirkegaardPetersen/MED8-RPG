Generated Ending:
The lone wanderer's story had ended in tragedy. His pursuit of becoming someone important led him down a path of destruction and chaos. He spent his time burglarizing noble houses and robbing banks, despite all the warnings of those who tried to help him. As word spread of his actions, he became known as a thief, a menace to the city.

Despite his charisma, the wanderer's karma had become so negative that even beggars avoided him. The once healthy wanderer had become a malnourished and weakened criminal. But there is one thing that he will be remembered for: his final act of foolishness.

In his attempt to steal from yet another noble house, he triggered a trap that poisoned him. As he lay there dying, he regretted all the wrong turns that he had taken. In the end, the only positive thing that could be said of him was that he had helped a farmer to collect his harvest, once.

The city tried to forget the wanderer's story, but his name lingered like a warning to those who dared to follow the same path. May his story and his fate be a reminder to all those who seek to gain glory in ways that hurt others.
