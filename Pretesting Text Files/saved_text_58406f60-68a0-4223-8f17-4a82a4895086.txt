Generated Ending:
After weeks of hearing whispers around the city, it became clear that the wanderer was nowhere to be found. Most assumed he had left town, unable to make a name for himself. But rumors suggested otherwise. It was said that he had ventured into the forest, trying to hunt for game. Unfortunately, a ferocious bear had got the better of him, leaving him in a state beyond repair. 

Despite his unfortunate end, the wanderer's legacy lived on. Although known as the strange loner who would perform strange rituals, the city would fondly remember him for his profound intelligence. His unusual habits drew those who wanted to expand their minds and he became the subject of much speculation. His final act of hunting might have been what did him in, and even still, people marveled at his incredible strength. While he may have left Kingstone in a near-unrecognizable state, the wanderer left an unforgettable mark on the city's people, who looked at him with a sense of both disbelief and admiration. A complex and enigmatic character, the wanderer would never be forgotten for his wisdom and his final remarkable strength.
